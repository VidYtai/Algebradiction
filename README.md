# Algebradiction: The Courtroom of Numbers

**Step into the courtroom where logic is law and mathematical mastery is your greatest weapon!**

Algebradiction is a unique educational game that transforms abstract mathematical concepts into a thrilling courtroom drama. You are the hero, a brilliant defense attorney tasked with representing clients who are not people, but mathematical ideas, equations, and geometric figures!

Your client—be it a misunderstood angle, a balanced equation, or a geometric shape—stands accused of being flawed, incorrect, or unbalanced. A zealous, and slightly silly, prosecutor will present arguments and evidence to prove your client's guilt. It's up to you to save the day!

## Features

-   **Become a Math Defender:** Take on the role of a defense attorney and fight for mathematical truth.
-   **Engaging Cases:** Each case is a unique, narrative-driven math puzzle based on real-world school curricula (covering topics from Classes 8, 9, and 10).
-   **Solve the Puzzle:** Dive into the evidence, from flawed diagrams to incorrect calculations, to find the key to your case.
-   **Present Your Argument:** Use your "Story Board" to construct a logical, step-by-step proof that demonstrates your client's innocence.
-   **"Wait a Minute!":** Listen carefully to the prosecutor's arguments. If you spot a mathematical fallacy, jump up and object!
-   **A Cast of Characters:** Interact with the impartial Judge, the ever-confident Silly Prosecutor, and your own helpful Co-Counsel who provides hints and guidance.
-   **Track Your Knowledge:** Every time you successfully defend a concept, the core mathematical principles are added to your "My Learnings" book, creating a personalized knowledge base of your achievements.
-   **Level Up:** As you win cases, you'll level up and face increasingly complex and challenging mathematical mysteries.

Do you have what it takes to expose the fallacies, present irrefutable proof, and declare your client... **INNOCENT**? The scales of justice are in your hands!
